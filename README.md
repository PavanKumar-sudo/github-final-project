A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r

Where:
- **P** is the Principal Amount (Initial amount of money)
- **T** is the Time Period (in years)
- **R** is the Annual Rate of Interest (in percentage)

## Input
- `P`: Principal amount
- `T`: Time period in years
- `R`: Annual rate of interest

## Output
- Simple Interest: The calculated interest over the given period.

## Example
If the input is:
P = 1000 T = 3 R = 5

Then the output will be:
Simple Interest = 150

## Usage

1. Input the values for principal, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.
2. The program will calculate and output the simple interest based on the formula.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script in your preferred programming language (Python, Java, etc.).
3. Enter the values for `P`, `T`, and `R` when prompted.
